        <p class="process-description">
          <br><br>
          During this phase, we closely analyzed AFRAKEN's requirements and deliverables. Our mission was to ensure our design was not only functional but also deeply aligned with their goals. <br><br>

          <strong>Ideating</strong> <br><br>
          We embarked on a rapid-fire ideation session, generating quick sketches. From these sketches, we then cherry-picked the most promising elements, weaving them into a cohesive final design that we collectively embraced. <br><br>

          <strong>Wireframing</strong> <br><br>
          Next, we crafted a wireframe, offering a skeletal preview of the websiteâ€™s architecture. This visual blueprint was instrumental in mapping out the website's structure and envisioning the user's journey through it. <br><br>

          <strong>Prototyping</strong> <br><br>
          We then transitioned from wireframes to a fully-fledged prototype, bringing the layout to life. This step was crucial for us to grasp the tangible interactions users would have with the website, refining our understanding of its usability and flow. <br><br>

            <br><br>
            This phase was a true test of our dedication and perseverance, as we often found ourselves working late into the night, tirelessly building the product to life. Embracing the challenge of learning WordPress, we dove headfirst into the platform, navigating its complexities with determination. <br><br>
            <strong>Finding the Right Plugin</strong>
            <br><br>
            One of the most unexpected hurdles was selecting the right plugins. The sheer number of available options was nothing short of overwhelming. Choosing the best plugins was critical to meeting the high standards we set for the project. <br><br>Despite the initial challenge, we rapidly adapted, honing our ability to sift through countless options and pinpoint the most effective solutions. <br><br>

          <p class="process-description">
            <br><br>
            As developers, we particularly enjoyed this phase because it allowed us to write custom code in PHP and JavaScript to achieve unique results. While finding the right plugins was initially challenging, by this stage we had mastered the process, making it much smoother. <br><br>
                      
            <strong>Configuring Local Payment Gateways</strong>
            <br><br>
            We integrated m-Pesa and various internationally recognized card payment options. This involved carefully selecting the right plugins and weaving them together to enable seamless subscriptions via m-Pesa. This task was intricate, yet rewarding, as it allowed us to enhance the project's functionality and user experience.
