            <p>In this initial phase, we carefully replicated the website design to capture all potential pain points and ensure client satisfaction with the chosen layout. This crucial step was executed using Figma, a powerful design tool that enabled precise visualizations.</p>

        <p class="process-description">
          <br><br>
          During this phase, we meticulously analyzed AFRAKEN's requirements and deliverables. Our mission was to ensure our design was not only functional but also deeply aligned with their goals. <br><br>

          <strong>Ideating</strong> <br><br>
          We embarked on a rapid-fire ideation session, generating quick sketches at lightning speed. From these sketches, we cherry-picked the most promising elements, weaving them into a cohesive final design that we collectively embraced. <br><br>

          <strong>Wireframing</strong> <br><br>
          Next, we crafted a wireframe, offering a skeletal preview of the websiteâ€™s architecture. This visual blueprint was instrumental in mapping out the website's structure and envisioning the user's journey through it. <br><br>

          <strong>Prototyping</strong> <br><br>
          We then transitioned from wireframes to a fully-fledged prototype, bringing the layout to life. This step was crucial for us to grasp the tangible interactions users would have with the website, refining our understanding of its usability and flow. <br><br>

            <br><br>
            This phase was a true test of our dedication and perseverance, as we often found ourselves working late into the night, tirelessly building the product to life. Embracing the challenge of learning WordPress, we dove headfirst into the platform, navigating its complexities with determination. <br><br>
            <strong>Finding the Right Plugin</strong>
            <br><br>
            One of the most unexpected hurdles was selecting the right plugins. The sheer number of available options was nothing short of overwhelming. Choosing the best plugins was critical to meeting the high standards we set for the project. <br><br>Despite the initial challenge, we rapidly adapted, honing our ability to sift through countless options and pinpoint the most effective solutions. <br><br>

            <br><br>
              As developers, we particulary loved this phase as we often found ourselves wrigin custom code in PHP and JavaScript to achieve various custom results. Finding the right plugins was a challenge too but at this point it was a breeze as we'd alreay learned the ropes <br><br>
            <strong>Configuring local payment gateways</strong>
            <br><br>
            We did integration of m-Pesa and various internationally recognized cards. This involved cherry piskig the right plugins and interwiving them closely to make it possible to make subscriptions possible using mpesa <br><br>
